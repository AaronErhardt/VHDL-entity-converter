Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. 'cd' to the directory containing this file 

  2. Type 'make' or your OS-specific make utility's command to compile
     the package. This will produce a executable in the 'bin' directory
     which is ready to use.


Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
are not considered in the current makefile.
You may want to add specific flags to the 'CXX_FLAGS' variable.
